## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}


library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(purrr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tibble)


ethereum_transaction_history <- read_csv("ethereum-historical-data\\EthereumTransactionHistory.csv", na = '#######')

time_unix <- lubridate::as_date(ethereum_transaction_history$UnixTimeStamp)

day_week <- lubridate::wday(as_date(ethereum_transaction_history$`Date(UTC)`, tz = "UTC", format = NULL))
##ggplot(data = ethereum_transaction_history, mapping = aes(x = ethereum_transaction_history$`Date(UTC)`, y = ethereum_transaction_history$Value)) +
 ## geom_point()
  
  

```
